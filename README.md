# Pixela UI

### A sleek, customizable desktop app for managing your [Pixela](https://pixe.la) graphs.

### Features:
  1. **Simple Gui**, **Easy to use**,
  2. ***Theme switching*** - Choose from a list of premade themes, or create one in the ```themes.json``` file (uses hex code)
  3. ***Graph Management*** - Create a new graph, create a new user, or add a new pixel to your graph
  4. ***View graph on browser*** - Open the graph on your default browser with a click of a button

### Adding soon!
  1. Feature to let the user create their theme
  2. Save themes from the previous session and use the same theme until changed (almost done!)
  3. Key Binds to make using the app faster (also almost done!)

### Requirements:
  1. Python 3.7 or higher (Download here: [Download python](https://python.org/downloads) ***Note: Python 3.xx may also work, but it's safer to use Python 3.7 or higher***
  2. TKinter library
